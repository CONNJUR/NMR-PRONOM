# NMR-PRONOM
Helping to establish digital signatures for common NMR file formats.

Oct-1-2018:  This is a quick and dirty README to jumpstart this repository. As the repo becomes populated with content, this README will be refined.  
Oct-17-2018:  This repository will attempt to adhere to the [Data Curation Format Profile](https://www.lib.umich.edu/blogs/bits-and-pieces/understanding-thorny-file-formats-netcdf-data-curation-format-profile-dcfp) (DCFP) from Michigan Library.

**The most important point to convey early on is that the example datasets will not be complete.**  GitHub is not designed to store large datasets.  Nor is the goal of this repo to provide complete test datasets.  The example files contained within will be the first few thousand and perhaps last few bytes of a file - just enough to provide the digital signature.

Each representative file format will contain this information:
* Format Name
* Version Number 
* Description
* Any Associated Extensions
* Any Associated MIME types
* Links to official documentation
* Links to representative files.
